# Automatic Classification of Consumer Goods

# Context 

Launch of an e-commerce marketplace by the company "Marketplace". In the Marketplace, sellers offer items to buyers by posting a photo and description.
Currently, the assignment of an item's category is done manually by sellers, and is therefore unreliable. In addition, the volume of articles is very small at this time.

To make the user experience for sellers (making it easier to put new items online) and buyers (making it easier to find products) as smooth as possible and with the perspective of scaling up, it becomes necessary to automate this task.

# Mission 

- Feasibility study of an article classification engine based on an image and a description for the automation of the attribution of the article category.

- Analysis of the dataset by performing preprocessing of product images and descriptions, dimension reduction, and then clustering. 


# Data 

1050 articles.

7 categories, each containing 150 articles:
- Baby Care
- Watches
- Beauty and Personal Care
- Home Decor Festive Needs, Home Furnishing o Computers
- Kitchen Dining

By article: photo and information (text): name, description, price, specifications.
